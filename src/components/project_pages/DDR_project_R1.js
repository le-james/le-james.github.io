                        <p>
                            The JuMP library contains useful functions to setup optimization problems and contain various solvers to use.

                        For this trajectory, the unicycle kinematics was used to model a differential drive robot (DDR) to move from some 
                        initial pose to a final pose. It is then discretized using the trapezoidal collocation into a number of knot points 
                        (state and control variables every timestep). These knot points are equality constraints which enforces the "dynamics 
                        of the system" and allows IPOPT to decide state and control variables that minimize a cost function. The cost 
                        function used here is the classic LQR cost function where Q and R are the tuning knobs for the state and controls.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                        For a known obstacle to avoid, an inequality constraint was added into the NLP where a boundary around the DDR should 
                        not be able intersect the boundary of the obstacle.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                        In the demo above, the DDRâ€™s goal is to move and park behind the red obstacle. It can be seen that it dodges the 
                        obstacle then reverses into the final pose.
